This is a Dockerfile that builds the linux dedicated server for Barotrauma.
At the moment it clones a specific commit from the Barotrauma source repo which
corresponds to v0.9.0.4.
You will need to build the image with a copy of the game in a directory called "game"
so the content directory can be pulled in. This is not distributed with the source.
